# Traffic-sign-detection-and-classification-using-GTSDB-dataset


**Description:**

In today's modern world, automation has streamlined many tasks, yet drivers often miss road signs while focusing on driving, potentially leading to dangerous situations. Our project addresses this issue by developing an advanced computer vision system that detects and classifies traffic signs, providing real-time alerts to drivers without diverting their attention. Furthermore, our application assists in overcoming the challenge of interpreting sign meanings, which can contribute to improved road safety.

**Key Features:**

- Accurate Detection and Recognition: Leveraging the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm, our system accurately detects and recognizes various types of traffic signs, including stop signs, speed limits, and yield signs.
  
- Multi-Sign Detection: The system can identify multiple traffic signs within a single image or video frame, offering precise bounding box localization for each detected sign.
  
- Real-Time Safety Enhancement: By offering drivers real-time information about encountered traffic signs, our solution contributes to safer driving practices and helps prevent accidents.

**Implementation:**

Our system comprises three core components:
  
- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: The RPN identifies potential sign locations within images or videos, aiding in efficient region selection.
  
- **Feature Extraction**: We employ pretrained models like ResNet or VGG16 to extract essential features from the detected regions.
  
- **Classification and Bounding Box Regression**: The classification model, often a convolutional neural network (CNN), predicts sign types and their probabilities, followed by bounding box regression to locate signs accurately.
  
To eliminate redundant detections and refine bounding boxes, we apply a non-maximum suppression technique.

**Dataset and Evaluation:**

Our project is developed and evaluated using the German Traffic Signs Database, an open-source dataset. We benchmark our model's performance against recent advancements in the field, considering metrics such as average precision (AP) and intersection over union (IoU).

**Contributions and Impact:**

By creating an accurate, real-time traffic sign detection and classification system, we aim to revolutionize road safety and minimize accidents caused by driver errors. This project showcases the potential of computer vision and deep learning to enhance society's well-being.
